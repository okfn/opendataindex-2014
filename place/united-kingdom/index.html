&lt;p&gt;Note that data offered by companies, citizen initiatives or any non-governmental organisation are not valid for submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we are looking only for what is officially published by governments. In some cases, the government will give the right to publish the data to third parties and in such cases submissions linking to third party sites are valid. It must, however, be explicitly stated on the data site that it is commissioned by the government (if the data is to be found on a company domain or on a domain of a civil society organisation or initiative, check if the organization has an agreement with the government to be the official source).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-file-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

If you can find it online, then it’s digital, even if it is just a scan of the paper the dataset is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that data can be digital, but not accessible online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: A country budget can be stored on a private network in the government, but not on the Internet. This means that the data is digital, but not publicly accessible, (which is our next criteria, see further below). Still, if you have knowledge that the data is digital somewhere inside the government (for instance, if the government official you speak to tells you so), then you should mark this one “YES” (and add in the notes that you have the information from a phone call with a certain department or official person).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-save"></i>&nbsp;</li>

Click &#34;Show more&#34; to she the conditions for publicly open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data can be considered public when:
1. It can be accessed online without the need for a password or permissions.
2. If the data is in paper form, can be accessed by the public and there is no restrictions on the number of photocopies that can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; publicly available in the following cases:
1. It can be made available only after a freedom of information request (FOIA) is sent.
2. It can be accessed only by government officials.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-eye"></i>&nbsp;</li>

Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;if it’s on the Internet and you can access it, it’s online. Notice that if the government emailed you the dataset but didn’t upload it to any webpage, it is not to be considered available online.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-download"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the data machine readable? Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Files are digital, yes, but not all can be  processed or parsed easily by a computer.  In order to answer this question, you would need to look at the datasets file type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb the following file types are machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the files are in the following formats, the are NOT machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JIF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JPEG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different file type and you don’t know if it’s machine readable or not, send an email to the Open Data Census list.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-keyboard-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in bulk? Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded easily. It is considered non-bulk if the citizens are limited to getting parts of the dataset through an online interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-copy"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openly licensed? Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This mean the data term and conditions follows The Open Definition, which stipulates that in order for data to be open, it needs to be free to use, reuse or to redistribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part.
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open).
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis? Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This means if the data is relevant to the year/time it is suppose to represent? Click &#34;Show more&#34; to learn about how to find information for this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it.
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section.
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment).
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>The data is published by the Ordnance Survey (<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/</a>) for Great Britain and is open data: <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html">https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html</a>.</p>
<p>The Ordnance Survey's OpenData suite of digital products includes 1:250,000 scale raster mapping for all of Great Britain, and additional national mapping at higher resolution (OS StreetView and OS VectorMap District). These products are actively maintained. As Ordnance Survey is the national mapping agency for Great Britain only, the coverage excludes Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</p>
<p>The Ordnance Survey's OpenData product suite includes mapping with better than 1:250,000 resolution (OS Street View) and is released under the OS OpenData Licence, which complies with the Open Definition. The mapping is updated regularly (most recently in May 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p>
<p>Separate data for Northern Ireland is provided by Ordnance Survey for Northern Ireland (OSNI) (<a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/ordnance-survey-of-northern-ireland">http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/ordnance-survey-of-northern-ireland</a>). Data for Northern Ireland is not yet available as open data (<a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/property-and-housing/your-neighbourhood-roads-and-streets/ordnance-survey-of-northern-ireland/product-range/digital-products.htm">http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/property-and-housing/your-neighbourhood-roads-and-streets/ordnance-survey-of-northern-ireland/product-range/digital-products.htm</a>).</p>
<p>OSNI sells it data (<a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/property-and-housing/your-neighbourhood-roads-and-streets/ordnance-survey-of-northern-ireland/product-range/paper-products/price-lists.htm">http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/property-and-housing/your-neighbourhood-roads-and-streets/ordnance-survey-of-northern-ireland/product-range/paper-products/price-lists.htm</a>). And data is not available on bulk for the whole national territory as it is split between the two websites.</p>
<p>Open data mapping for Northern Ireland is not currently available at resolutions of 1:250,000 or better.</p>

&lt;p&gt;For example: A country budget can be stored on a private network in the government, but not on the Internet. This means that the data is digital, but not publicly accessible, (which is our next criteria, see further below). Still, if you have knowledge that the data is digital somewhere inside the government (for instance, if the government official you speak to tells you so), then you should mark this one “YES” (and add in the notes that you have the information from a phone call with a certain department or official person).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-save"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb the following file types are machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the files are in the following formats, the are NOT machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JIF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JPEG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different file type and you don’t know if it’s machine readable or not, send an email to the Open Data Census list.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-keyboard-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in bulk?

&lt;p&gt;For example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-copy"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openly licensed?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part.
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open).
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis? Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This means if the data is relevant to the year/time it is suppose to represent? Click &#34;Show more&#34; to learn about how to find information for this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it.
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section.
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment).
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>The UK's Electoral Commission publishes an authoritative collection of electoral results (including general elections, local council elections and EU Parliament elections). The results are collected from local returning officers by a third party on behalf of the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission makes the bulk data available for download in CSV and Excel spreadsheet formats. In October 2013 the Electoral Commission updated the terms on its website to make it clear that the electoral data was re-usable under the Open Government Licence. Data is provided timely. The data was last updated in May 2014 with results of the local council and European Parliament Elections.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it.
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section.
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment).
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>Central Government departments are required to regularly publish lists of all financial transactions spending over £25,000; some departments publish transactions down to £500 or lower. The business rules and the format is described at <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_transparency_index.htm">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_transparency_index.htm</a> The data is re-usable under the UK's Open Government Licence. In addition summarised spending information by month x department x type of goods/services is available quarterly from the Treasury (Ministry of Finance) COINS/OSCAR database - see for instance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-oscar-publishing-from-the-database">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-oscar-publishing-from-the-database</a> This is also available under the Open Government Licence. The data was last updated/released in September 2014.</p>
<p>2014 reviewer comment: The data in no longer available through COINS or 'Where does my money go'. It can be found on data.gov.uk platform. I added the correct link to the information and a link to the data license.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part.
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open).
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>

- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it.

- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself.

- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>Generally public transport in the UK is run by private companies, with some government or municipality regulation. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) national passenger rail timetable information is available on <a href="http://data.atoc.org/rail-industry-data">http://data.atoc.org/rail-industry-data</a> and updated weekly; registration is required but free, and once registered the data can be downloaded in bulk under CC-BY UK ported (checked 20 Oct 2013). Fares data is available from the same source under the same licence. Daily schedules of all trains and real-time running information (down to individual signalling events) is available on <a href="https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk">https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk</a> under a licence based on UK OGL v1.</p>

An open data source for (privately operated) national coach services or for rail and bus services in the devolved province of Northern Ireland is not known.

<p>It cannot be downloaded in bulk and is not provided in a machine readable format (only PDF).

Also a general problem is that both data providers are private entities and not an official government related source.</p>

On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part.
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open).
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it.
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section.
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment).
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>Update: While you need to fill out a form in order to get access to the Ordnance Survey's Code-Point Open dataset, the Office for National Statistics publishes postcode data under an open licence publicly on the web.</p>
<p>Revision: you need to fill a form to get access to this dataset. Then you get a link by email.</p>
<p>Open postcode data which meets the specification here (postcodes and corresponding geospatial locations - lat/long or equivalent) is available via the Ordnance Survey's Code-Point Open dataset, which contains the 1.4m GB post codes each with a UK national grid reference of the postcode's location in eastings and northings (convertable to lat/long by published formulae) and with the administrative area (country/county/district/ward, plus National Health Service Region and Authority) in which it is located. This is updated quarterly. Similar Postcode data for the devolved province of Northern Ireland is <em>not</em> available as Open Data. The main UK <em>address</em> database (~24m individual addresses) is confusing called the Postcode Address File. This is a subscription-only database privately owned by the Royal Mail. The Open Data User Group have been pressing for its release too - see <a href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/dont-sell-our-postcodes-odug-on-why-we-should-have-open-addressing-in-the-uk">http://data.gov.uk/blog/dont-sell-our-postcodes-odug-on-why-we-should-have-open-addressing-in-the-uk</a>
The Postcode data as of August 2014 is available here: <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/PostCodes/ONSPD_AUG_2014_csv.zip">https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/PostCodes/ONSPD_AUG_2014_csv.zip</a>
The geographic coverage is United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland). More detailed information on the dataset can be found here: <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid={473A5770-FB1B-4C1A-AEEC-5DC056E5EC7F}">https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid={473A5770-FB1B-4C1A-AEEC-5DC056E5EC7F}</a></p>

                    <p>A comprehensive database of UK legislation is maintained online by The National Archives, an agency of the Ministry of Justice. The information is re-usable under the UK's Open Government Licence. -- update after asking National Archives and checking online ---
A variety of machine readable formats are available through the API - see <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/formats">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/formats</a> (amended machine-readable to yes and updated formats). Currently the database is <em>not</em> downloadable in bulk. Initially the target was to provide this by end-March 2014</p>
<p>Update on Bulk Download: We received the following response following a request for an update on the progress that has been made towards offering bulk download: " We have made some progress on bulk downloads and there is currently a project underway to make bulk downloads of all legislation.gov.uk data publicly available. Some data is already available at <a href="http://leggovuk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">http://leggovuk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/</a> in XML and HTML formats. However it should be noted that this is a trial site that is expected to change. New legislation is published on a daily basis as are amendments to existing legislation. The download site is currently still in development so is not being regularly updated with new content at the present time.  At the moment there are no bulk downloads available for PDFs. The data on legislation.gov.uk has been collated over a number of years from a variety of sources and is not all in the same base format. We plan to make available a dataset of original print PDFs - these are versions of the original hardcopy documents as published. However, we do not hold all legislation in this format so this will not contain all the legislation on the website."</p>

                    <p>The position seems to be as follows. There is an annual "Budget speech" and documents are published online by HM Treasury and are re-useable under the terms of the UK's Open Government Licence. For 2014 all the documents are provided in PDF format. However this does not usually include detailed departmental budgets. Departmental level budgets are in a number of places, but the two collections available regularly free of charge under the UK Open Government Licence are: (1) the annual "Estimates" published each April for the financial year commencing that April. These are published in PDF format department by department and are at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-main-estimates">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-main-estimates</a> for the last three years 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 The dataset for this fiscal year is available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/main-supply-estimates-2014-to-2015">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/main-supply-estimates-2014-to-2015</a>. This dataset is "up to date" (2) the same, and some more detailed, data is contained in the "Plans" part of the COINS/OSCAR dataset <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins">http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins</a> (this also contains matching expenditure information). Although the expenditure information is published quarterly, the "plans" are not currently published in OSCAR data until the end of the financial year to which they relate. Once Plans information is available on OSCAR it is available for bulk download in machine readable format (CSV). In assessing the ratings fairly it was necessary to choose between the "Estimates" and "OSCAR" versions - the OSCAR version seemed closer to the ideal, even though it was not as up to date, and that is assessed here. - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oscar-annual-data-october-2014">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oscar-annual-data-october-2014</a></p>

&lt;p&gt;For example: A country budget can be stored on a private network in the government, but not on the Internet. This means that the data is digital, but not publicly accessible, (which is our next criteria, see further below). Still, if you have knowledge that the data is digital somewhere inside the government (for instance, if the government official you speak to tells you so), then you should mark this one “YES” (and add in the notes that you have the information from a phone call with a certain department or official person).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-save"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOC&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part.
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open).
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>

Click &#34;Show more&#34; to learn about how to find information for this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it.
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section.
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment).
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>Realtime and recent historical data about <em>observed</em> levels of air pollutants and particulates at 128 automatic observing stations across the UK are at <a href="http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk">http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk</a>. Pollutants covered include Ozone, Nitric oxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Nitrogen oxides as nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, Carbon monoxide, PM10 particulate matter, Non-volatile PM10, Volatile PM10, PM2.5 particulate matter, Non-volatile PM2.5, and Volatile PM2.5. All this data is under the Open Government Licence. An RSS feed of latest data is available at <a href="http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/rss/current_site_levels.xml">http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/rss/current_site_levels.xml</a> , although this points to HTML pages such as <a href="http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/site-data?f_site_id=ACTH&amp;view=last_hour">http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/site-data?f_site_id=ACTH&amp;view=last_hour</a> . The Data Selector <a href="http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector">http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector</a> allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave "The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns."). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual <em>emissions</em> of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from <a href="http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector">http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector</a>, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications. Some complete datasets are available as open data, notably from Defra: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs/series/air-quality-and-emissions-statistics">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs/series/air-quality-and-emissions-statistics</a>. Some environmental data is subject to additional licensing arrangements - see for instance <a href="http://www.geostore.com/environment-agency/WebStore?xml=environment-agency/xml/ogcDataDownload.xml">http://www.geostore.com/environment-agency/WebStore?xml=environment-agency/xml/ogcDataDownload.xml</a></p>

                    <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics has primary responsibility for maintaining and publishing national economic and demographic information (including the Census). ONS material is re-usable under the terms of the Open Government Licence and UK Government Licensing Framework. <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/index.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/index.html</a> lists (as of 14 Oct 2013) 13059 datasets and reference tables available under the OGL. Each of the datasets is downloadable in full, machine-readable formats (mainly Excel, but some also available in CSV and XML).
Data is not available in bulk - users must download each file separately.
There are a variety of Census 2011 datasets including population by local authority (<a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-the-united-kingdom---part-1/rft-ks101uk.xls">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-the-united-kingdom---part-1/rft-ks101uk.xls</a>), GDP dataset (2Q2013 at <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/q2-2013/tsd-quarterly-national-accounts--q2-2013.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/q2-2013/tsd-quarterly-national-accounts--q2-2013.html</a> with links to XML and CSV formats), and unemployment by age and duration (<a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/september-2013/table-unem01.xls">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/september-2013/table-unem01.xls</a>) Some, but not all, of these datasets are fed onto data.gov.uk Statistics are released according to a published schedule.</p>
